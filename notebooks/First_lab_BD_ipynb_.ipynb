        ">Therefore we need to develop an **Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model** in order to `compute the customer perception`. Due to the presence of non-useful characters (collectively termed as the noise) along with useful data, it becomes difficult to implement models on them."

        "> What is **`Logistic Regression ?`** <br>\n",
        "> - **Logistic regression** is a `statistical analysis method` to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set. It is used in statistical software to `understand the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables` by estimating probabilities using a logistic regression equation. \n",
        "> - **Logistic regression** is `used when your Y variable can take only two values, and if the data is linearly separable`, it is more efficient to classify it into two seperate classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "> What is **`Bernoulli Naive Bayes ?`** <br>\n",
        "> - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** implements the naive Bayes training and classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate Bernoulli distributions.\n",
        "> - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** is one of the variants of the Naive Bayes algorithm in machine learning. It is very useful to be used when the dataset is in a binary distribution where the output label is either present or absent.\n",
        "\n",
        "> What is **`SVM ?`** <br>\n",
        "> - **Support Vector Machine** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say regression problems as well its best suited for classification. The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.\n",
        "> - **Support vector machines** are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. The advantages of support vector machines are: Effective in high dimensional spaces. Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "> What is **`Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) ?`** <br>\n",
        "> - **Term Frequency** gives us information on how often a term appears in a document.\n",
        "> - **Inverse Document Frequency** is a measure of whether a term is common or rare in a given document corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "> What is **`Stemming and lemmatization ?`** <br>\n",
        "> - The goal of both  **`stemming`** and  **`lemmatization`** is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. \n",
        ">- For instance:\n",
        ">  - **`am`**, **`are`**, **`is`** $\\Rightarrow$ **`be`**\n",
        ">  - **`car`**, **`cars`**, **`car's`**, **`cars'`** $\\Rightarrow$ **`car`**\n",

        "> - After training the model we then apply the evaluation measures to check how the model is performing. Accordingly, we use the following evaluation parameters to check the performance of the models respectively :\n",
        "> - **`Accuracy Score`** : Typically, the accuracy of a predictive model is good (above 90% accuracy)\n",
        "> - **`Execution time`** : Variable that depends on the machine on which the program was executed, but which can give a small idea of the model that executes the fastest.\n",
        "> - **`F1 score`** : The F1 score is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall such that `the best score is 1.0` and `the worst is 0.0`. **F1 scores are lower than accuracy measures** as they embed precision and recall into their computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> - **`ROC-AUC Curve`** : The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve. The higher the AUC, the better the performance of the model at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes.\n",
        "> - **`Confusion Matrix with Plot`** : A Confusion matrix is an N x N matrix used for evaluating the performance of a classification model, where N is the number of target classes. The matrix compares the actual target values with those predicted by the machine learning model. Note that :\n",
